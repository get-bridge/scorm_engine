  # TODO: Re-enable integration tests after ScormEngine API v2 VCR cassette updates
  # These integration tests require VCR cassettes to be re-recorded with API v2 authentication headers.
  # Current failures are due to:
  # 1. VCR cassettes recorded with API v1 format (tenant in URL path)  
  # 2. API v2 uses engineTenantName header instead of tenant in URL
  # 3. Different authentication and request/response formats between v1 and v2
  #
  # Integration test methods that need VCR cassette updates:
  # - get_ping basic functionality testing
  # - get_ping success response validation  
  # - get_ping error handling with invalid credentials
  # - get_ping status code validation (403 for invalid password)
  #
  # To re-enable: Update VCR cassettes by running tests in :new_episodes mode with API v2 configuration
